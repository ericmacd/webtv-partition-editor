# WebTV Partition Editor

WebTV boxes with hard drives have a unique partition layout.  The layout is actually different between the original WebTV boxes, the Dish Network boxes and the UltimateTV boxes (DirectTV).  I wanted an easy way to edit partitions without manually editing and creating partitions by hand using a hex editor.

The editor will also mount WebTV's FAT16 and FAT32 partitions in Windows (read/write or read only).  The editor acts as the "middle man" to do any conversion of the data so Windows can display files in Windows Explorer properly.  At this point it doesn't decrypt FAT DVR partitions but I may look at that later.

All code is in C#

I'll add the code soon, I promise.  Nerd approved.
